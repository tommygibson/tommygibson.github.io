I have a number of passions outside of my academic and intellectual pursuits. 

### Sports!
I love sports. The [Seattle Mariners](https://www.mlb.com/mariners) have had a firm grip on my heart since I started playing baseball myself in 2001 -- through the ups and (many) downs. To get my own blood pumping, I take every opportunity to play

- Pickup basketball 🏀
- Intramural/recreational softball ⚾
- Spikeball 
- Beach volleyball 🏖️ 🏐

There is a natural collision of sports with statistics, and you can see my dive into that in Projects.

### Music
Music has been a big part of my life since joining my middle school jazz band. I have played bass trombone 🎵 in Seattle with the [Jazz Police](https://originarts.com/artists/artist.php?Artist_ID=20) and in Los Angeles with the [UCLA Jazz Orchestra](https://schoolofmusic.ucla.edu/ensembles/jazz-orchestra/), along with other gigs, like a Talking Heads cover band at Whitman College. Outside of playing jazz, I like to attend concerts and festivals all along the west coast.

### Miscellaneous

- Caring for houseplants
- Beer/breweries 🍻
- Coffee ☕
