It took a few days, but I finally got the hang of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and all the formatting options it allows. Now that I've gotten the hang of it, I hope to post something new every few weeks -- whether it be about statistics, coding, sports, coffee, or something else entirely. If you share some similar interests, check 'em out! 

I would write something about my beloved [Mariners](https://www.mlb.com/mariners), but they were [no-hit yesterday](https://www.mlb.com/mariners/news/mariners-no-hit-by-orioles-john-means). Further, `` it was the first time in Major League history that a perfect game was broken up by a dropped third strike that allowed a runner to reach." Horray for obscure baseball statistics! I'll wait to write about them until they're coming off a better day at work.
