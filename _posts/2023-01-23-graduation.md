Well, my original plan to write regular blog posts was cast to the wayside in favor of a push to finish my PhD. Speaking of which, I defended my dissertation on December 2, 2022 and Iâ€™m officially done! For anyone interested in some dense reading, [Bayesian Meta-analysis Methods for Improving Accuracy and Adjusting for Publication Bias](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/2330j8w2) is publicly available for all to see. 

With more free time on my hands I am destined to post more frequently than I have been, i.e. more than once every ~18 months. Stay tuned for an upcoming sports analysis post in the next week or two!
