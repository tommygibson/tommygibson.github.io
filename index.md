I'm PhD candidate in [biostatistics](https://www.biostat.ucla.edu/) at the University of California, Los Angeles. My advisor is [Dr. Rob Weiss](https://robweiss.faculty.biostat.ucla.edu/) and I'm currently doing research with [Dr. Ron Brookmeyer](https://ph.ucla.edu/faculty/brookmeyer) on Alzheimer's disease. This website is a place where you can learn about my professional work in statistics, fun side projects about sports analysis, and other things that are meaningful to me. 

To get a flavor for my personal keys to happiness check out the [About](about) page.

The [Posts](posts) page contains miscellanous blog posts about stats, sports, their interactions, and more.

You can also view my list of current [publications](publications) and [research interests](research).
