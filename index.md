Current PhD candidate in [biostatistics](https://www.biostat.ucla.edu/) at the University of California, Los Angeles. This is a place where you can learn about my professional work in statistics, fun side projects about sports analysis, and other things that are meaningful to me. 

To get a flavor for my personal keys to happiness check out the [About](about) page.

The [Posts](posts) page contains miscellanous blog posts about stats, sports, their interactions, and more.
